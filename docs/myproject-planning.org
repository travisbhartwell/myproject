#+title: MyProject Planning

* Project Task Runner
** TODO =project.find_files_for_filset= should be additive
** TODO =project.find_files_for_filset= should support symlinks and files with spaces in them

* Milestones
** Features to Design and Explore
*** TODO Data structures/split between Task Definitions and Task Execution
*** TODO Intra- and Inter- project code re-use
*** TODO Out of band =myproject= directories and configuration
*** TODO Declaring task dependencies on one another

** Dog Fooding
*** TODO Remove =myproject-tasks= file
*** TODO Remove =mycmd/project= from MyCmd
*** TODO Rename MyProject's =mycmd/myproject= to =mycmd/project=
*** TODO Convert all personal =myproject= files to =myproject= directories
*** TODO Create snapshot

** 0.1
*** TODO End User Documentation
*** TODO Installation Documentation
*** TODO CI using GHA
*** TODO Emacs support for executing tasks outside of my own dotfiles
*** TODO Announcement development log post
*** TODO Announcement YouTube video

** Post-0.1
*** TODO Command-line completion for tasks for =mycmd project run=

* Work Log Posts
** TODO Introduction to MyProject

* Next Steps
** TODO Freewrite about design of out of band =myproject= directories and configuration
** TODO Implement and test =project.find_up= using that

* Strategies and Goals

My development process should follow the following tenants:

** When I need to figure out something, use Free Writing to figure out the simplest possible thing that could work.
** Document each design decision (even tenuous ones) in the [[file:myproject-design.org][MyProject Design Document]].
** When previous decisions end up not working, repeat the process and update the design document.
** When implementing a design, start by breaking down the next steps in small increments in this planning document.
** Implement those design decisions in as small of increments as I can, using automated testing to give feedback, especially when the increment isn't enough to execute meaningfully.
** These small increments can be as small as "create a  placeholder function"; anything to promote momentum.
** Use [[https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects][demo-driven development]]; iterate quickly towards being able to show the code working.
