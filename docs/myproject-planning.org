#+title: MyProject Planning

* Project Task Runner
** TODO =project.find_files_for_filset= should be additive

* Milestones
** Features to Design and Explore
*** TODO Data structures/split between Task Definitions and Task Execution
*** TODO Intra- and Inter- project code re-use
*** TODO Out of band =myproject= directories and configuration
*** TODO Declaring task dependencies on one another

** Dog Fooding
*** TODO Remove =myproject-tasks= file
*** TODO Remove =mycmd/project= from MyCmd
*** TODO Rename MyProject's =mycmd/myproject= to =mycmd/project=
*** TODO Convert all personal =myproject= files to =myproject= directories
*** TODO Create snapshot

** 0.1
*** TODO End User Documentation
*** TODO Installation Documentation
*** TODO CI using GHA
*** TODO Emacs support for executing tasks outside of my own dotfiles
*** TODO Announcement development log post
*** TODO Announcement YouTube video

** Post-0.1
*** TODO Command-line completion for tasks for =mycmd project run=

* Work Log Posts
** TODO Introduction to MyProject
** DONE Weekly Progress Report with weekly demo
SCHEDULED: <2025-01-03 Fri>
** TODO Weekly Progress Report with weekly demo
SCHEDULED: <2025-01-10 Fri>

* Next Steps
** DONE Add more details to [[file:~/Developer/Personal/myproject/main/README.md][README]]
** DONE Freewrite about design of out of band =myproject= directories and configuration

* Next Demo
** DONE Minimal =mycmd myproject list-tasks= that prints project root and MyProject task definition root
SCHEDULED: <2025-01-03 Fri>
*** DONE Implement and test the basic =project.find_up= which simply looks for =myproject/main=
*** DONE Implement and test the =_MYPROJECT_MAPPINGS= associative array, test and use that in =project.find_up=
*** DONE Implement and test parsing the =MYPROJECT_MAPPING= environment variable in =project.find_up=
*** DONE Implement function to check if it is a valid Task Definition directory and use it in =project.find_up= and =project._find_up=
*** DONE Implement separate =project._load_mapping_configuration= function and call it from =project.find_up=
*** DONE Implement tests for =project._is_valid_task_definition_directory=
*** DONE Test that =MYPROJECT_MAPPING= is ignored for invalid directories
*** DONE Implement and test parsing the MyProject Mapping Configuration File using the =MYPROJECT_MAPPING_CONFIG= environment variable
*** DONE Add trace logs for =_MYPROJECT_MAPPINGS=
*** DONE Test that the config file can handle using =~= for home
*** DONE Test the priority of =MYPROJECT_MAPPING= over =MYPROJECT_MAPPING_CONFIG=
*** DONE Implement minimal =mycmd myproject list-tasks= that calls =project.find_up=
*** DONE Implement and test parsing the MyProject Mapping Configuration File from the standard location


** Working =mycmd myproject list-tasks= that will load tasks from a =myproject/main=
SCHEDULED: <2025-01-10 Fri>
*** TODO Clean up and re-organize =project-lib-test=
*** TODO Document existing concepts and conventions to the [[file:myproject-concepts-and-conventions.org][Concepts and Conventions Document]]
*** TODO Freewrite about task registry design
*** TODO Write design of task registry

* Strategies and Goals

My development process should follow the following tenants:

** When I need to figure out something, use Free Writing to figure out the simplest possible thing that could work.
** Document each design decision (even tenuous ones) in the [[file:myproject-design.org][MyProject Design Document]].
** When previous decisions end up not working, repeat the process and update the design document.
** When implementing a design, start by breaking down the next steps in small increments in this planning document.
** Implement those design decisions in as small of increments as I can, using automated testing to give feedback, especially when the increment isn't enough to execute meaningfully.
** These small increments can be as small as "create a  placeholder function"; anything to promote momentum.
** Use [[https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects][demo-driven development]]; iterate quickly towards being able to show the code working.
** Once a feature is complete:
*** Take a pass to add details to the [[file:myproject-concepts-and-conventions.org][Concepts and Conventions Document]] and update the implementation and testing code to fit.
*** If it is a user-facing feature, add appropriate documentation to the End User Documentation.
